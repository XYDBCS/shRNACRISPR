# This is the code for manuscript "Systematic comparison of CRISPR and shRNA screens to identify essential genes using a graph-based unsupervised learning model"
# The python file "Step 1" predicts the esseitiality probability of each genes.
# The file "Step 2" gets the essential genes and non-essential genes based on the predicted results from Step 1.
# The file "Step 3" shows the converge of the unsupervised model.
# The file "Step 4" compare the distributation of essential genes under high and low expression.
# The file "Step 5" shows the scatter plot of the gene essentiality score and gene expression with marginal density plots and the kernel density estimate
# The file "Step 6" shows the comparison of all the essential and nonessential genes identified by shRNA and CRISPR under 8 groups.
